//Some mods can't use dds textures yet or this program have problems converting them in the correct format. All mods folders listed below will be skipped during a folder conversion (case-sensitive), or will have forced parameters applied.
//You can specify a folder, or a file directly. Folders listed will include their sub-directories
// if you use any argument, the folder is not skipped and all files in it will be treated accordingly.
//Available arguments :
//	" -fn" (Force Normals): Force all files to be considered as normals. They will be swizzled to xRxG format and flagged as normal.
//	" -nn" (Not Normals): Force all files to skip automatic normal detection and to be flagged as not normal.
//	" -nr" (No Resize): Skip resizing for files in the folder. Relevant only if you use the resizing option.
//	" -nm" (No Mipmaps): Deactivate mipmaps generation for files in the folder.
//Applying arguments to a folder will override arguments for single files in this folder/subfolder.
//Others arguments are coming Soon(tm).
